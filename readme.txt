## What is this?
This is intended to be a very stripped back theme starter built for me :)
It's basically the Underscores theme with modern tooling!

## What's included?
- Webpack compiled js for npm and es6 support
- Supports Typescript
- Supports React (and React in Typescript)
- Uses SCSS
- Uses svgstore
- local dev environment with BrowserSync
